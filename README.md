**Notes for the reader**

In this mini-project, I built an associative array data structure, focusing on generics and parametric polymorphism to allow key-value pair storage, for many (and combined) data types. The implementation involves defining an `AssociativeArray` class that stores key-value pairs, supporting operations such as setting, getting, removing values, and checking for key existence. To ensure efficiency, the project includes methods for cloning arrays and managing the array's capacity.
